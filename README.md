# Where We Measured Map

What is this repository for?
This repository contains the scripts needed to create the Where We Measured Map. It processes the data outputs collected during each day of measurements to create a web map with the roads where we did measurements represented by blue lines and the location of the observed enhancements of methane concentrations represented by coloured dots: yellow for small enhancements (between 0.04 ppm and 0.4 ppm), orange for medium enhancements (between 0.4 ppm and 1 ppm) and red for large enhancements (above 1 ppm). 

How do I get set up?  
To set it up, clone the entire repository to your local machine. All the scripts were written using R and requires the following packages: readr and googleway. Further instructions on running the scripts can be found on the Where We Measured Map protocol.
